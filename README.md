# Hand Pass

Hand Pass is an easy way to make and present QR Codes for other people to scan. You can use QR Codes to share specific information and trigger actions on the scanning device. Hand Pass aims to be an accessible, reliable and cross-platform way to exchange information in person.

## Usage

Hand Pass is designed to be used from your phoneâ€™s Home Screen for quick access. If you want to use Hand Pass, visit https://handpass.app and install it.

## Functions

The initial release of Hand Pass has three functions, "Give Phone Number", "Give Email Address" and "Give Hand Pass App". Hand Pass is designed to have an expanding set of functions that represent different use cases.

## Attribution

Hand Pass uses the excellent QR Code generator library from Project Nayuki. The live demo in particular is incredibly useful for building an intuition for how QR Codes work.
