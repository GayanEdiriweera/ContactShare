# **pass.contact**
**pass.contact** is a simple way to generate QR codes from your contact information. You can use these QR codes to pass your contact information directly from your device to someone elseâ€™s device.

**pass.contact** does not send your contact information over a network connection. QR codes that you generate using **pass.contact** encode your contact information. Any device that scans your QR code will decode a copy of that information.
