# Hand Pass

Hand Pass is a simple way to make and present QR codes for other people to scan. You can use QR codes to share specific information and trigger events on the scanning device. Hand Pass aims to be an easy, robust and cross-platform way to exchange information in person.

## Usage

Hand Pass is designed to be used from your phoneâ€™s Home Screen for quick access. If you want to use Hand Pass, visit https://handpass.app and install it.

## Functions

Hand Pass is designed to have an expanding set of functions that perform different use cases. The initial release has only one simple function called Text Back. Text Back lets you make a QR Code from your phone number. A person who scans the code is instantly prompted to send a text message back to you. This makes Text Back a fast, reliable way to swap phone numbers in person. No need to say your number out loud. No need to give your device to another person. Connect in a couple of taps.

I plan to release more functions via updates to the Hand Pass app. I hope to produce designs that are as accessible and useful as possible.
