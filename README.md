# Hand Pass

Hand Pass is a simple way to swap phone numbers in person. No need to give your phone to the other person. No need to say your number out loud. 

Use Hand Pass to present a QR code of your number for the other person to scan. Upon scanning, the other person is prompted to return a message back to you. 

A few taps and you're connected.
