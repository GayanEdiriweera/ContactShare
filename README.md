# Hand Pass

Hand Pass is a simple way to swap phone numbers in person. You don't need to pass your phone to the other person. You don't need to say your number out loud like a crazy person.

Use Hand Pass to present a QR code of your number for the other person to scan. Upon scanning, the other person receives a prompt to return a message back to you. A few taps and you are connected and chatting.
